# find-kagglers
### Find competitors of Kaggle.com with the same Country and City as you.

This Jupyter Notebook returns the Country and City from each one of the top Kagglers (from [Competitions Leaderboard](https://www.kaggle.com/rankings)).

So, you can use this notebook to find the kagglers with the same __city__ and __country__, for networking purposes.

Note that you need ***chromedriver.exe*** in the same folder of this Jupyter Notebook to run it. This is a WebDriver for Google Chrome browser, an open source tool for automated testing of webapps.
