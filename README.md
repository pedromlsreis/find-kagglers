# find-kagglers

This Jupyter Notebook returns the Country and City from each one of the top Kagglers (from [Competitions Leaderboard](https://www.kaggle.com/rankings)). You can find it useful to find *kagglers* from the same city or country as you, for networking purposes.

Note that you need ***chromedriver.exe*** in the same folder of this Jupyter Notebook to run it. This is a WebDriver for Google Chrome browser, an open source tool for automated testing of webapps.
